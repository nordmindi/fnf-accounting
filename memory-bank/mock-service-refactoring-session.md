# Mock Service Refactoring Session

## Overview
This session focused on refactoring the Fire & Forget Accounting system to eliminate hardcoded strings and implement a proper mock service pattern with clean separation between mock and real data.

## Key Requirements Addressed
- Remove all hardcoded strings from the codebase
- Implement proper mock service pattern
- Ensure mock data is completely separate from real business logic
- Maintain configuration-driven behavior for switching between modes

## Architecture Changes

### Before Refactoring
- Single `ImprovedBookingService` with hardcoded mock data mixed with real logic
- Hardcoded booking IDs, dates, and sample data in production code
- Configuration flag controlled initialization but data was still mixed

### After Refactoring
- **MockBookingService**: Dedicated service containing all sample/mock data
- **RealBookingService**: Clean service with no hardcoded data, only processes real documents
- **BookingServiceFactory**: Factory pattern to choose between services based on configuration
- Complete separation of concerns

## Files Created

### New Services
1. **`src/app/mock_booking_service.py`**
   - Contains sample booking data for testing/demos
   - Hardcoded sample booking ID: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440010`
   - Sample representation meal booking with Swedish VAT rules
   - All mock data isolated in this service

2. **`src/app/real_booking_service.py`**
   - No hardcoded data whatsoever
   - Only processes real data from actual document uploads
   - Clean production-ready service
   - Generates real UUIDs and timestamps

3. **`src/app/booking_service_factory.py`**
   - Factory pattern implementation
   - Reads `USE_MOCK_DATA` configuration
   - Returns appropriate service instance
   - Clean dependency injection

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- **`src/app/dependencies.py`**: Updated to use factory pattern
- **`src/app/routers/documents.py`**: Updated to use factory-created service
- **`src/app/routers/bookings.py`**: Updated to use factory-created service
- **`src/orchestrator/simple_pipeline.py`**: Updated to use factory-created service

### Configuration Files
- **`env.example`**: Added `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` configuration
- **`src/infra/config.py`**: Added `use_mock_data` field to Settings
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Added `USE_MOCK_DATA` environment variable to containers

### Test Scripts
- **`scripts/test-no-mock-data.sh`**: Fixed to handle empty responses correctly
- **`scripts/toggle-mock-data.sh`**: Created for easy switching between modes
- **`Makefile`**: Added `test-no-mock` and `toggle-mock` commands

## Files Removed
- **`src/app/improved_booking_service.py`**: Replaced by factory pattern

## Testing Results

### Mock Data Mode (`USE_MOCK_DATA=true`)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bookings?company_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
# Returns: [{"id":"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440010",...}]
```
- ✅ Returns sample booking with hardcoded data
- ✅ Contains Swedish representation meal example
- ✅ Suitable for demos and testing

### Real Data Mode (`USE_MOCK_DATA=false`)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bookings?company_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
# Returns: []
```
- ✅ Returns empty array initially
- ✅ Creates real bookings from actual document uploads
- ✅ No hardcoded data in the system
- ✅ Production-ready behavior

### Complete Flow Test
The `make test-no-mock` command successfully tests:
- ✅ Initial state clean (no mock data)
- ✅ Document upload working
- ✅ Pipeline processing working
- ✅ Booking creation working
- ✅ Pipeline-to-booking mapping working
- ✅ Multiple bookings created from real documents

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between mock and real services
2. **No Hardcoded Data**: All hardcoded strings moved to dedicated mock service
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Easy switching between modes via environment variable
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to add new mock data or modify real service logic
5. **Testable**: Clear distinction between test data and production data
6. **Production-Ready**: Real service contains no test artifacts

## Usage Commands

```bash
# Switch to mock data mode (for testing/demos)
make toggle-mock  # Sets USE_MOCK_DATA=true
make down && make up
# Returns sample booking data

# Switch to real data mode (for production)
make toggle-mock  # Sets USE_MOCK_DATA=false  
make down && make up
# Returns only real data from actual documents

# Test complete flow with real data only
make test-no-mock

# Test with mock data
make test-api
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Factory Pattern
```python
class BookingServiceFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_booking_service():
        settings = get_settings()
        if settings.use_mock_data:
            return MockBookingService()
        else:
            return RealBookingService()
```

### Configuration Integration
```python
# src/infra/config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    use_mock_data: bool = Field(True, env="USE_MOCK_DATA")
```

### Docker Integration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  USE_MOCK_DATA: ${USE_MOCK_DATA:-true}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Mock data should be completely isolated from production logic
2. **Factory Pattern**: Effective for configuration-driven service selection
3. **Environment Variables**: Proper Docker integration requires explicit environment variable passing
4. **Testing**: Both modes need comprehensive testing to ensure proper behavior
5. **Clean Code**: Removing hardcoded strings improves maintainability and reduces bugs

## Future Considerations

1. **Database Integration**: When moving to persistent storage, mock service could use in-memory database
2. **Mock Data Management**: Could add more sophisticated mock data management
3. **Service Interfaces**: Could define common interfaces for better type safety
4. **Configuration Validation**: Could add validation for configuration values

## Session Summary

Successfully refactored the system from a mixed mock/real service to a clean factory pattern with complete separation between mock and real services. All hardcoded strings removed from production code, and the system now supports clean switching between test and production modes via configuration.

The refactoring maintains all existing functionality while improving code quality, maintainability, and following proper software engineering principles.
