## Part A ‚Äì Executive Summary

### 1. Vision
**Fire & Forget Accounting** is an AI-driven platform that transforms bookkeeping into a fully automated, language-based experience.  
Users simply say or type:  
> ‚ÄúBook this receipt for a business lunch,‚Äù  
and upload the receipt. The system extracts data, interprets intent, applies accounting and tax rules, and posts the correct journal entry‚Äîfully compliant, explainable, and auditable.

The concept: **hands-free, regulation-safe, one-minute bookkeeping**.

---

### 2. Market Context & Opportunity
Nordic small businesses and accounting firms face a paradox:
- They are **digitally mature** (high SaaS adoption, bank API integrations).
- Yet **manual bookkeeping persists** (receipt handling, VAT, representation, expense categorization).

The addressable market:
- ~2 million SMEs in the Nordics.
- >40% report bookkeeping as their top administrative burden.
- Existing solutions (Fortnox, Visma, Tripletex, Bokio, Pleo) offer **semi-automation**, but rely on human confirmation.

**Gap:** True ‚Äúfire-and-forget‚Äù automation‚Äîwhere AI + rule engine + compliance logic make confident, explainable, and lawful decisions.

---

### 3. Value Proposition
- **Human-free bookkeeping:** Upload, confirm, done.  
- **Built-in Nordic compliance:** Follows BAS (SE), SAF-T (NO), SKAT (DK), and Finnish accounting standards.  
- **Explainable AI:** Every automated decision includes reasoning and traceable policy reference.  
- **Adaptive learning:** Learns from user corrections and vendor history.  
- **Audit-ready:** Immutable WORM logs, reversible transactions, and VAT-compliance validation.  

---

### 4. Key Risks and Mitigation

| Risk Area | Description | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Legal/Compliance** | Incorrect handling of VAT or representation could breach tax law. | Versioned policy engine, legal review per country, ‚Äústoplight‚Äù control (green/yellow/red). |
| **AI Misclassification** | LLM hallucinates or misclassifies. | JSON-schema enforcement, confidence scoring, rule-based overrides. |
| **Trust & Liability** | Businesses fear errors or unclear responsibility. | Transparent reasoning layer, rollback system, limited liability terms. |
| **Data Privacy (GDPR)** | Receipts contain personal data. | EU-hosted, data minimization, on-device OCR, encryption, DPIA. |
| **Regulatory Drift** | Tax laws evolve annually. | Modular rule versioning (‚Äúeffective-from‚Äù metadata), CI-based policy testing. |

---

### 5. Legal & Regulatory Landscape (Nordic Focus)

**Sweden (SE)**  
- Bookkeeping Act: 7-year retention; original image required.  
- VAT: 25/12/6% rates; representation deduction limited.  
- BFN: ‚ÄúGod redovisningssed‚Äù; BAS plan required.  

**Norway (NO)**  
- Regnskapsloven: 5-year retention; SAF-T reporting mandatory.  
- MVA: 25/15/12%; ‚Äúmva-koder‚Äù must match accounting system.  
- Focus: automation accepted but audit trail required.  

**Denmark (DK)**  
- Bogf√∏ringsloven: digital bookkeeping mandatory (from 2024).  
- VAT: 25%; representation rarely deductible.  
- SKAT requires transaction-level traceability.  

**Finland (FI)**  
- Bookkeeping Act: 6-year retention.  
- VAT: 24/14/10%; strong regulation around mixed rates.  
- FAS-compliant structure, strict document auditability.  

**Pan-Nordic Legal Themes:**  
1. Strict retention (5‚Äì7 years).  
2. Original receipt format preservation.  
3. Representation and VAT complexity.  
4. Reconciliation between bank feeds and ledgers.  
5. Auditability and explainability expectations.

### 6. Strategic Pilot Plan (8 Weeks)

| Sprint | Focus | Deliverables | Validation |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Core OCR & Intent Engine | Upload ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí basic classification | Internal test data |
| 2 | Rule Engine + Stoplight Model | Auto-booking + confidence gating | Accounting review |
| 3 | WORM & Compliance Layer | Immutable logs + reversible bookings | Auditor validation |
| 4 | Pilot with Swedish SME & partner accountant | Measure automation precision | Pilot report |
| 4.5 | Nordic Readiness Check | Add DK/NO/FI VAT schemas | Compliance matrix |

---

### 7. Success Metrics & Go/No-Go Criteria

| Metric | Target | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Automation Rate (Green)** | ‚â•60% | % of transactions fully automated |
| **Precision (Top Scenarios)** | ‚â•95% | Correct account/moms/dimension mapping |
| **Time-to-Book** | <15s median | End-to-end latency |
| **Exception Rate** | <10% | % flagged for manual review |
| **User Adjustment Rate** | <5% | % of auto-posts later changed |
| **VAT Compliance Errors** | <1% | Detected inconsistencies |

**Go/No-Go Decision:**  
Proceed to Beta rollout only if ‚â•4 of 6 KPIs are met and auditor approval granted for compliance layer.

---

### 8. Nordic Expansion Strategy
- **Phase 1 (SE)**: Focus on representation, travel, SaaS subscriptions.  
- **Phase 2 (NO)**: Integrate SAF-T schema, MVA code mapping.  
- **Phase 3 (DK)**: Add SKAT compliance export, extend rule set for non-deductible meals.  
- **Phase 4 (FI)**: Extend VAT module and FAS integration.  

---

## Part B ‚Äì Technical RFC / Design Specification

### 1. Objective & Scope
Build a **Nordic-ready AI-driven accounting engine** that automates bookkeeping via natural language and receipts, maintaining full compliance and auditability.

**Goals**
- Multi-country rule engine (SE, NO, DK, FI)
- Stoplight auto-booking system
- Hybrid AI (LLM + deterministic policy)
- Zero-touch processing pipeline
- Compliance-first data architecture

---

### 2. Core Architecture Overview

User Input (voice/text)
‚Üì

NLU Layer (Intent + Entity Extraction)
‚Üì
Rule Engine (Policy Match + Country Layer)
‚Üì
Confidence Evaluation (Stoplight: Green/Yellow/Red)
‚Üì
Accounting Core (Journal Entry + Ledger Update)
‚Üì

- OCR: Tesseract (local) + Vision API fallback
- LLM: Local (vLLM) or API (OpenAI, Anthropic) with strict schema enforcement
- Policy Engine: JSON-rule DSL (`$gt`, `$in`, `$and`) + version control

---

### 3. Policy Layer & Rule Engine Design
Each country has:
- **Core Policy Layer:** shared business logic (debit=credit, date rules, etc.)
- **National Policy Module:** VAT rules, representation limits, retention periods
- **Company Overrides:** custom mappings, internal dimensions

Rules are stored as:
```json
{
  "country": "SE",
  "version": "2025-10-A",
  "effective_from": "2025-10-01",
  "conditions": {
    "intent": "representation_meal",
    "amount": {"$lt": 10000},
    "currency": "SEK"
  },
  "actions": {
    "accounts": [
      {"account": "6071", "side": "D"},
      {"account": "2641", "side": "D"},
      {"account": "1930", "side": "K"}
    ],
    "vat_code": "REP12",
    "requires_fields": ["purpose", "participants"]
  }
}
4. AI & NLP Components
Intent Model: Identifies transaction type (representation, taxi, SaaS, etc.)

Entity Extractor: Pulls context from receipts and text (vendor, VAT, amount, participants).

Confidence Scoring: Combines LLM probability + rule validation output.

Language Coverage: sv, no, da, fi, en.

Retraining Loop: Uses user corrections and yellow-zone feedback.
